# Game Story
_initial story_
Some mad scientist lab, experimenting on interbreeding monsters to solve puzzles 

In your lab, you have some weird looking creatures, each has their own powers. they interbreed to have yet weirders offsprings. 

not only that, you could even expose the offsprings to abnormal environments to mutate their powers, you might weaken them and occasionaly give them new powers.


### the HUB
- Game setting inside a lab, they called it the _HUB_
- a HUB has the following corners/rooms:
    - the _Incubator_: where you make your breeding experiments
    - your _e-Banking Page_: where you track your funds, and maybe ask for loans
    - your _inventory_ or _pantry_: where you store purchased and collected items
    - the _e-Market_: where you buy and sell items
    - _Comms_: where you dispatch your monsters to perform tasks; this leads to playable missions 
    - _HAB_: where you keep your live monsters, plant food, and feed monsters
    - _Research Files_: where you keep monster and plant DNAs and a profile of each monster/plant 

### Game Dynamics 
You start the game with a basic lab, with basic equipment and basic DNAs to start with.
You use the _Incubator_ to breed monsters and plants from parent DNAs and some external factors (as supported by the incubator)
Each monster/plant offspring is a hybrid of both parents plus some random mutation as per your incubator equipment.
Each monster/plant has traits defined by their DNA as percentage of their total energy, e.g. you might have a monster with 3% for flying, 15% for strength, 9% for intelligence, 32% for agility, and so on, and the remaining would be towards inefficiency. final traits would be the product of those weights and total creature energy, which in case of monsters would be food yield, and in case of plants would be light, and soil quality.
you use your plants in the HAB garden to grow food for your monsters, you feed your monsters, then using the comms, you dispatch monsters to perform some tasks, each task yields some money, towards your e-banking, which can be used to buy lab upgrades, DNAs, food, or even pay for utilities 

we were thinking of the name _Monster Nursery_ as a name.
