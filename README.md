# Game Off 2018
A Seed Repository to participate in the [Game Off 2018](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2018)

There are some openios to name this game __Monster Nursery__ since this game is about breeding monsters to acheive tasks. It is more of a realtime strategy game, with lots of mini-games attached to it.

We are currently in Game Story phase, and once it is decided, we will move towards assets preparation, then code development. 
This game is likely to be written in C#, Unity, and is likely to be 2D console game, with some chances of porting it to a web interface.
